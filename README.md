# In-Development

This is a motion detector application still in development for the raspberry pi.

The quickstart.py just takes input from the camera and uploads it to google drive.

The Motion_Detection.py shows the motion detected in the form of artficially drawn contours. It saves a local copy of a jpg file. This file is then uploaded and an email is sent to the user telling that the motion is detected. This is the actual project.
